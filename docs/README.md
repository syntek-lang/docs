```syntek
var direction = 1

function arrowUp() {
  direction = 0
}

function arrowRight() {
  direction = 1
}

function arrowDown() {
  direction = 2
}

function arrowLeft() {
  direction = 3
}

function loop() {
  if direction is 0 {
    moveUp()
  } else if direction is 1 {
    moveRight()
  } else if direction is 2 {
    moveDown()
  } else if direction is 3 {
