# Operators
Operators in Syntek are kept to the bare minimum. Some operators found in other programming languages are not implemented to keep the language as easy as possible for beginners.

## Arithmetic
Syntek only contains the essentials arithmetic operators. The operators are listed in the table below.

| Operator | Description | Example | Result |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| +        | addition    | 5 + 2   | 7      |
| -        | subtraction | 5 - 2   | 3      |
| /        | division    | 5 / 2   | 2.5    |
| %        | modulo      | 5 % 2   | 1      |
| ^        | pow         | 5 ^ 2   | 25     |

Operators such as `++` and `--` are not implemented, as they can be confusing to beginners. The functionality of these operators are also minor, as they can just be written as
```
x = x + 1
x = x - 1
```

## Assignment
The only assignment operator is `=`, because operators such as `+=`, `/=` and others can be confusing for beginners.
```
x = 5
x = x + 5
y = x - 5
y = y / 2
```

## Comparison
Comparison operators are written in plain English to make it easy to read. All comparison operators are listed in the table below.

| Operator        | Description  | Example             | JavaScript |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|
| is              | equal to     | a is 5              | a === 5    |
| is not          | not equal    | a is not 5          | a !== 5    |
| is greater than | greater than | a is greater than 5 | a > 5      |
| is less than    | less than    | a is less than 5    | a < 5      |

## Logical
Logical operators are also written in plain English. All logical operators are listed in the table below.

| Operator | Example       | JavaScript |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| and      | true and true | &&         |
| or       | true or false | \|\|       |
| not      | not false     | !          |

## Example
Function using a comparison operator:
```
function factorial(x)
  if x is 0
    return 1
  else
    return x * factorial(x - 1)
```
