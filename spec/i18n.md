# Internationalization

Syntek makes it possible to use different languages through i18n (internationalization) files.

## i18n files

::: warning
This is only the concept, the actual implementation may change in the future.
:::

i18n files are written in YAML and provide translations for messages in Syntek. They are divided into sections to make it easier to navigate.

Some lines may include placeholders, which can be included using the mustache notation `{{}}`.

```yaml
compiler:
  lexer:
    unexpected-token: 'Unexpected token {{token}} at {{line}}:{{column}}'

  parser:
    if:
      expression-after-if: 'Expected an expression after if'
      indent-after-if: 'Expected an indent after if statement'
    else:
      indent-after-else: 'Expected an indent after else'
```
