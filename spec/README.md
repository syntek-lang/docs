# Introduction

Syntek is an educational programming language. It is designed to provide a beginner friendly programming environment. Syntek can be used in an object oriented, functional, and imperative manner. It is optionally typed, and provides automatic memory management. Syntek draws inspiration from [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), and [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)).

Syntek is statically and dynamically checked. Any error during compile time or runtime will stop execution. Syntek gives warnings at compile time when best practices are not followed.

Syntek is highly configurable to suit the needs for assignments. You can disable functionality, such as operators, to provide strict rules on what is allowed during assignments. An assignment may also provide global functions, classes, variables, and modules through native bindings with the language of the implementation.
